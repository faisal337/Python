##Requesting input from the user
a = int(input("Enter the integer a: "))
b = int(input("Enter the integer b: "))

sum = a+b
difference = b - a
product = a*b
quotient = a//b
remainder = a%b
product = a*b


##Printing the result
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum} ")
print(f"The difference of {a} and {b} is {difference} ")
print(f"The product of {a} and {b} is {product} ")
print(f"The quotient of {a} and {b} is {quotient} ")
print(f"The remainder of {a} and {b} is {remainder} ")
print(f"The result of {a} and {b} is {product} ")
